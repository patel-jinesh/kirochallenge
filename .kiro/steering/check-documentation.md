# Documentation Checking

## AWS-Related Questions
When the user asks about AWS services, features, configurations, or best practices:
- Use the AWS documentation search tools available via MCP
- Search for current, accurate information rather than relying solely on training data
- Check for recent updates and new features
- Verify API syntax and parameters from official docs

## Common AWS Topics to Search
- Service configurations and setup
- CDK construct usage and patterns
- Lambda function best practices
- API Gateway configurations
- DynamoDB table design
- IAM policies and permissions
- CloudFormation/CDK resource properties
- Error messages and troubleshooting

## Search Strategy
1. Use specific service names in searches
2. Include the programming language/framework when relevant (Python, CDK, etc.)
3. For errors, search the exact error message
4. Check both reference documentation and best practices guides
